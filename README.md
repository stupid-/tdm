# Team Deathmatch

I was looking for a more competetive gamemode for my community, so I decided to start coding a public Team Deathmatch Gamemode. This is my first project, and I have only just started learning GLua, and don't have any prior programming experience. If you have any suggestions or issues, just let me know.

## Current Version

11-01-17

## Installation

Drop the /tdm/ folder into the garrysmod/gamemodes folder and you are done. On your server, set your gamemode to tdm.

Add any content files in the content folder to your fastdl server.
